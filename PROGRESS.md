### PR #7 smoke path (local — onboarding, brand voice, analytics, bulk)

1. Apply the new migration in Supabase:
   `lib/db/migrations/0003_steady_patch.sql` (adds onboarding tracking
   columns to `organizations` and brand-voice extension columns to
   `brand_voices`).
2. `npm run dev`. Log in as a fresh user (or clear
   `organizations.onboarding_completed_at` and `onboarding_step` on an
   existing one).
3. You land at `/onboarding?step=welcome` automatically (the redirect
   from `/`). Click **Start setup**.
4. Business step → set the name and save. Industry step → pick a vertical
   (the brand voice gets seeded from the pack defaults).
5. Google step → if not connected, it links to `/locations`. Click
   **Continue** to proceed even when fixture mode is off — connecting
   Google is optional during onboarding.
6. Notifications step → toggle email/SMS, type a phone, save.
7. Voice step → tweak tone preset, response length, emoji, signature, notes
   → **Finish setup**. You land on `/dashboard` and the "Finish setup" nav
   badge disappears.
8. `/dashboard`:
   - Stats: Total reviews / Avg rating / Response rate / AI usage.
   - Second row: Unanswered / This week / This month / Posted.
   - Two cards: rating distribution (CSS bars) + 8-week trend (CSS bars).
   - Empty-state cards if there are no reviews yet.
9. `/settings`:
   - Onboarding completion row shows the completion date.
   - Industry pack picker, Brand voice form, Notifications form all save
     independently.
10. `/inbox` (still works as before):
    - New top-left checkbox per row.
    - Sticky bulk-actions bar with "0 selected" indicator.
    - On Starter/Growth: bar shows "Bulk actions are Pro-only. Upgrade →"
      and buttons are disabled.
    - On Pro: select 2-3 reviews, click **Generate drafts** (uses cached
      drafts where available), **Post selected** (posts to Google in
      fixture or live mode), **Mark skipped**, **Export CSV** (downloads a
      `autofivestar-reviews-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`).
11. Generate a draft on any review → the new brand voice instructions
    (tone preset, length, emoji policy, custom notes) flow into the user
    message. Inspect `audit_logs` for a `draft.generated` row.

### PR #6 smoke path (local — poller + alerts)

Prereqs: PR #4 (Google connected, location connected) + PR #5 (AI generate
working).

1. Apply the new migration in Supabase:
   `lib/db/migrations/0002_faithful_jack_murdock.sql` (adds three columns
   to `users` + adds `skipped` to the `notification_status` enum).
2. Install Inngest CLI: `npm i -g inngest-cli` (or
   `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`).
3. Start the Inngest dev server in another terminal:
   ```bash
   npx inngest-cli@latest dev
   ```
   It auto-discovers <http://localhost:3000/api/inngest>. Visit
   <http://localhost:8288> to inspect runs.
4. Start the Next.js app: `npm run dev`. The poller is now registered.
5. Open `/settings` → enable Email alerts (default on), enable SMS alerts
   if the org is on Growth/Pro, fill in `+15551234567` as the
   notification phone. Save.
6. Trigger the cron manually from the Inngest dev UI:
   - Functions → `pull-reviews-cron` → "Invoke"
   - Or send a `reviews/sync.requested` event with
     `{ "orgId": "...", "locationId": "..." }` to skip the cron.
7. Expected behavior (in fixture modes `GBP_LIVE=false`, `EMAIL_LIVE=false`,
   `SMS_LIVE=false`):
   - `pullGoogleReviews` upserts 8–12 fixture reviews per location.
   - On the **first run** every review is `inserted`, so each one fans out a
     `reviews/new.detected` event.
   - For each event:
     - 1–2 star → email sent (fixture log) + SMS sent (fixture log if
       Growth/Pro + phone + opted in)
     - 3 star → `notifications` row with `event=review.alert.daily_digest_pending`,
       `status=queued`
     - 4–5 star → `event=review.alert.weekly_digest_pending`, `status=queued`
   - On **subsequent runs** no new review IDs come back (xmax≠0 on upsert),
     so no events fan out.
8. Verify in DB:
   - `notifications` has one row per (recipient × channel × review) and
     payload contains the review and location ids
   - `_fixture: true` merged into payload for fixture-sent rows
   - Skipped rows have `errorMessage` like `missing_phone_number`,
     `alerts_sms_disabled`, `plan_does_not_allow_sms`, or `sms_disabled`
9. `/dashboard` shows:
   - "Last review sync" timestamp in the header
   - "Negative reviews to handle" card listing up to 3 urgent reviews
   - "Pull reviews now" ghost button
10. `/inbox` rows show the rose **Needs attention** pill on unanswered 1–2
    star reviews.

Live mode (when ready):

- `RESEND_API_KEY=re_…`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=hello@your-domain.com`,
  `EMAIL_LIVE=true` — once your domain is verified at Resend.
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`,
  `SMS_LIVE=true` — only after A2P 10DLC campaign approval.
- Production with `EMAIL_LIVE=false` / `SMS_LIVE=false` still works: those
  notifications get `status=skipped` with a clear `errorMessage` instead of
  silently swallowing the alert.

### PR #5 smoke path (local — AI drafts + post to Google)

Prereqs from PR #4: signed up, connected Google (fixture mode), pulled
reviews on at least one location.

1. With `.env.local` having `AI_LIVE=false` (default) — no OpenAI key
   required:
   - `npm run dev`, open `/inbox`, click a review.
   - The right pane shows **Generate AI drafts**. Click it.
   - Three variants appear (Warm / Professional / Brief), tuned to the
     review's sentiment.
   - The `usage_counters` row for this month bumps `ai_responses_used` by 1.
2. Pick a variant tab. The textarea fills with the draft body. Edit it.
3. Click **Save edits**. A `review_responses` row is created with
   `status=draft`; the review stays as `drafted`.
4. Click **Approve**. Status flips to `approved` on both rows.
5. Click **Post to Google**. With `GBP_LIVE=false` the post is simulated:
   - `review_responses.status=posted`, `posted_at` set,
     `source_response_id=fixture-…`
   - `reviews.status=posted`
   - Audit log gets `response.posted` with `fixture: true`
6. Go back to `/inbox`. The row now shows a green **Posted** action and a
   `posted` status badge.
7. Negative-review path: open a 1- or 2-star review. The workspace shows
   the "Negative review: review carefully…" warning.
8. Yelp path (if a Yelp review exists from PR #4 fixtures): the **Post**
   button is replaced with **Copy to clipboard** and the explanatory note.
9. Quota path:
   - Switch the org plan to Starter via `/billing` or by updating the DB
     row directly.
   - Manually set `usage_counters.ai_responses_used = 50`.
   - Click Generate → the action returns "Monthly AI response quota
     reached" and links to `/billing`.

Live OpenAI:

1. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…` and set `AI_LIVE=true`.
2. Restart dev. Click Generate. Three variants are now generated by the
   model named in `OPENAI_MODEL_PRIMARY` (default `gpt-4o`).
3. `response_drafts.model` reflects the model id; `cost_cents` is the
   estimated USD-cents total split across the three rows.

Live Google posting:

1. Once Google approves `business.manage`, set `GBP_LIVE=true` and
   reconnect a real location.
2. Generate + approve + post → the real `accounts/{a}/locations/{l}/reviews/{r}/reply`
   endpoint is hit. Errors map to typed reasons (`not_connected`,
   `refresh_failed`, `google_rate_limited`, `review_removed`, `unauthorized`,
   `google_api_error`) which the action surfaces back to the UI.

### PR #4 smoke path (local — GBP connect + manual sync)

Demo mode (no Google Cloud setup required):

1. Make sure `.env.local` has `GBP_LIVE=false` (default) and
   `ENCRYPTION_KEY` set.
2. `npm run dev`, sign in, go to `/locations`.
3. Click **Connect Google**. You'll be back at `/locations?google=connected`
   instantly — an encrypted synthetic token row is in `integration_tokens`.
4. Pick the **AutoFiveStar Demo HVAC** account (or Dental). A list of fake
   locations appears.
5. Click **Connect** on one. You land at `/locations?google=location_connected`
   and the location appears in the "Connected locations" grid.
6. Click **Pull reviews now** on the location. 8-12 fixture reviews land in
   the DB and the badge updates.
7. Go to `/inbox`. The reviews show with stars, reviewer name, status
   badges, and source. Filter by status / rating / source.
8. Click any review → `/reviews/[id]` shows the full review and the
   placeholder for the AI drafts (PR #5).
9. Try connecting a second location on Starter plan → the **Connect**
   button is disabled with "Quota reached".

Live mode (after Google approves `business.manage`):

1. In Google Cloud Console, create an OAuth 2.0 Web client with redirect
   `https://your-domain/api/integrations/google/callback`. Request the
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage` scope on the OAuth
   consent screen and submit for verification.
2. Set `.env.local`:
   ```
   GBP_LIVE=true
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google/callback
   ```
3. Restart dev. Click **Connect Google** → Google consent screen → land
   back at `/locations?google=connected` with real tokens in
   `integration_tokens`.
4. Account / location picker now shows real GBP data. Connecting + pulling
   reviews talks to the live API.

### PR #3 smoke path (local — Stripe billing)

1. Create three Stripe products in test mode (Starter, Growth, Pro), each
   with one monthly and one yearly recurring price:
   - Starter: $49/mo, $490/yr (2 months free baked in)
   - Growth: $99/mo, $990/yr
   - Pro: $199/mo, $1,990/yr
2. Copy the six price IDs into `.env.local`:
   `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_MONTHLY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_YEARLY`,
   `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH_MONTHLY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH_YEARLY`,
   `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEARLY`.
3. Install Stripe CLI: <https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli>.
   ```bash
   stripe login
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
   ```
   Copy the `whsec_…` printed by `stripe listen` into
   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` and restart `npm run dev`.
4. Sign up, go to `/billing`. Toggle monthly/yearly. Click "Start 14-day
   trial" on Growth.
5. Stripe Checkout opens. Use card `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry,
   any CVC, any postal code.
6. Redirect back to `/billing?checkout=success`. Within a few seconds the
   webhook fires and updates:
   - `subscriptions` row created
   - `organizations.plan` updated to `growth`
   - `organizations.trial_ends_at` set
   - `usage_counters` row for the current month exists
   - `audit_logs` has `subscription.created` entries
7. Click "Open billing portal" → Stripe Portal → cancel subscription. The
   `customer.subscription.updated` webhook syncs `cancel_at_period_end=true`,
   and once the period ends `customer.subscription.deleted` reverts the org
   plan to `starter`.
8. Run `stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed` — webhook accepts it and
   writes an audit log entry.

### Webhook events handled

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

Unknown event types receive a 200 (Stripe will stop retrying).

### PR #2 smoke path (local)

1. `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill in Supabase URL/anon/service-role
   keys, `DATABASE_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`),
   and any Stripe test keys. Skip GBP/Twilio/Yelp for this PR.
2. In Supabase SQL editor, run `lib/db/migrations/0000_*.sql` then
   `lib/db/policies/0001_rls.sql`.
3. `npm run db:seed` (optional — system templates).
4. `npm run dev`, visit <http://localhost:3000>.
5. Sign up with email + password.
   - If email confirmation is enabled in Supabase, click the link → lands at
     `/auth/callback` → bootstrap runs → `/onboarding`.
   - If confirmation is disabled, signup redirects to `/onboarding` directly.
6. Verify in DB:
   - `users` has your row
   - `organizations` has one row with a Stripe customer ID (if Stripe key set)
   - `org_members` has one row with role `owner`
   - `brand_voices` has one row
   - `usage_counters` has one row for the current month
   - `audit_logs` has one `org.created` entry
7. Click "Go to dashboard" → counts render. Click around inbox/locations/
   settings/billing — all load without errors.
8. Log out → redirected to `/login`. Log back in → land at `/dashboard`
   without re-running bootstrap (idempotent).
9. Try logging in with Google → consent screen → `/auth/callback` →
   `/dashboard`. The same user reuses the same org.
